# Mobile Application Development(MAD)

KOTLIN:

A statically-typed, object-oriented and functional programming language developed by JetBrains - developers of the IntelliJ IDE which Android Studio is based on
Compiles to Java bytecode, therefore compatible with the Java Virtual Machine
Because of this, Kotlin code can be mixed with Java code in one application
Main site: here
Recommended as the preferred language to develop Android apps, so its beneficial to start by looking at the basics of Kotlin before beginning Android development.

# Some Kotlin features

Null safety: language features to help guard against the dreaded NullPointerException!

Type inference: type of variables can be inferred by what they are initialised to, so you don't need to explicitly declare the data type.

Lambda functions: anonymous functions which can be passed as arguments to other functions (similar to arrow functions in JavaScript).

Data classes: concisely create classes which represent data and do not need methods.

Extension functions: add a single function (method) to an existing class without needing to subclass it.

Coroutines: a lightweight approach to multi-tasking. producing code which is easier to follow compared to threads.
